Fastload utility helps you to quickly load the data
in empty tables of your teradata database.

#02
For this process, you'll need two files
	1. The file from which you'll extract the data also known as 
	   the datafile (this may be your txt file or a csv file, etc.)
	2. The fld file which will contain the actual script, this script
	   will help your system load complete data to the database.

#03
Important concepts to remember about fld script
	1. LOGON 174.11.19.90/Your_ACC_NAME,Your_ACC_PASSWORD;
	   the ip_address(of organization's data)/
	   the account_name/account_password.
	2. set record vartext "|";
	   this is a very important line, your datafile(txt or csv)
	   contains the attributes and these attributes posses thousands
	   of lines of data, this line helps the system to recognize attribute
	   based on this delimiter.
	   Example:
	   syed_arfa|22|UET Taxila --> AttrVal_1(syed_arfa)
	   AttrVal_2(22)  AttrVal_3(UET Taxila) Note that these 3 values
	   are recognized by separting them with "|" delimiter.
	3. Three Necessary tables are created 
           1.The actual table, in our case, its name is NewCustomer_By_Arfa
	   2.The Error table #01 which will record errors related
	     to data types, in our case its name is NewCustomer_By_Arfa_UCV(you can have any name of these files)
	   3.The Error table #02 which records errors related to duplicate records
	     in our case,its name is, NewCustomer_By_Arfa_TV
	4. file="D:\PTCL\FASTLOAD\CustomerRecByArfa.txt";
		this is the path to your datafile.
